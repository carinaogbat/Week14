We spent a full month bottle feeding her and she has grown into a big, fluffy, and beautiful cat. Unfortunately Orion is very very spicy. So spicy in fact, that a lot of the times we have to avoid her when we're in the house. The spicyness hits randomly, so we never know what we're going to get. A neighbor even nicknamed her 'Mr. Steal-Your-Face' because she will literally try and take your face off. Whoops.",
